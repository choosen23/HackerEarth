Given a 10^6 * 10^6 matrix with each cell initially consisting of zero values. The input given consists of 
co-ordinates of cells which have to be marked as 1. Letâ€™s call them true cells. We have to find the number of 
pairs of such true cells which are in the same diagonal.

Can you help him out?
